**💈 Clients monorepo**
========================

Just a collection of popular Python clients, used across others repos.\
Examples: clients for AWS infra services (Parameter Store, Lambda, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, 
 ...),\ clients for other infra services (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure), clients for
 web services like Gmail API, etc.

Each client is a standalone Python project that can be installed individually 
 from the subdir.

List of clients:
 - [aws-parameter-store-client](aws-parameter-store-client): to read/write parameters 
    and secrets from AWS Parameter Store. 
 - [aws-lambda-client](aws-lambda-client): to get a Lambda URL; to invoke a Lambda with
    a custom event.


🎯 Target Python version
=========================

The target is a Python version that is recent enough, but not too recent for a wide
 compatibility.\
Python 3.10 seems a good compromise.

*Note: Python 3.10 introduced the annotation `| None` for optional types, among other things.*


🛠️ Development setup
====================

1 - System requirements
----------------------

**Python 3.10**\
The target Python 3.10 for a wide compatibility.\
Install it with pyenv:
```sh
$ pyenv install -l  # List all available versions.
$ pyenv install 3.10.16
```

**Poetry**\
Pipenv is used to manage requirements (and virtual environments).\
Read more about Poetry [here](https://python-poetry.org/). \
Follow the [install instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions).

**Pre-commit**\
Pre-commit is used to format the code with black before each git commit:
```sh
$ pip install --user pre-commit
# On macOS you can also:
$ brew install pre-commit
```

2 - Virtual environment and requirements
----------------------------------------

Create a virtual environment and install all deps with one Make command:
```sh
$ make poetry-create-env
# Or to recreate:
$ make poetry-destroy-and-recreate-env
# Then you can activate the virtual env with:
$ eval $(poetry env activate)
# And later deactivate the virtual env with:
$ deactivate
```

Without using Makefile the full process is:
```sh
# Activate the Python version for the current project:
$ pyenv local 3.10  # It creates `.python-version`, to be git-ignored.
$ pyenv which python
/Users/nimiq/.pyenv/versions/3.10.16/bin/python

# Now create a venv with poetry:
$ poetry env use ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.16/bin/python
# Now you can open a shell and/or install:
$ eval $(poetry env activate)
# And finally, install all requirements:
$ poetry install
# And later deactivate the virtual env with:
$ deactivate
```

To add new requirements:
```sh
$ poetry add requests

# Dev or test only.
$ poetry add -G test pytest
$ poetry add -G dev ipdb

# With extra reqs:
$ poetry add -G dev "aws-lambda-powertools[aws-sdk]"
$ poetry add "requests[security,socks]"

# From Git:
$ poetry add git+https://github.com/aladagemre/django-notification

# From a Git subdir:
$ poetry add git+https://github.com/puntonim/utils-monorepo#subdirectory=log-utils
# and with extra reqs:
$ poetry add "git+https://github.com/puntonim/utils-monorepo#subdirectory=log-utils[rich-adapter,loguru-adapter]"
# and at a specific version:
$ poetry add git+https://github.com/puntonim/utils-monorepo@00a49cb64524df19bf55ab5c7c1aaf4c09e92360#subdirectory=log-utils
# and at a specific version, with extra reqs:
$ poetry add "git+https://github.com/puntonim/utils-monorepo@00a49cb64524df19bf55ab5c7c1aaf4c09e92360#subdirectory=log-utils[rich-adapter,loguru-adapter]"

# From a local dir:
$ poetry add ../utils-monorepo/log-utils/
$ poetry add "log-utils @ file:///Users/myuser/workspace/utils-monorepo/log-utils/"
# and with extra reqs:
$ poetry add "../utils-monorepo/log-utils/[rich-adapter,loguru-adapter]"
# and I was able to choose a Git version only with pip (not poetry):
$ pip install "git+file:///Users/myuser/workspace/utils-monorepo@00a49cb64524df19bf55ab5c7c1aaf4c09e92360#subdirectory=log-utils" 
```


3 - Pre-commit
--------------

```sh
$ pre-commit install
```


🚀 Deployment
=============

Libs are *not deployed* as they can be (pip-)installed directly from Github o local dir 
 (see Usage section in each lib's main README.md).\
And *not versioned* as when (pip-)installing from Github, it is possible to choose
 any version with a hash commit (see Usage section in each lib's main README.md).
